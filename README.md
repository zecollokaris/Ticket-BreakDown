## [Ticket Breakdown](Ticket_Breakdown.md)
This project contains two challenges - a "Ticket Breakdown" challenge and a "Refactoring" challenge. Any written answers should be included in markdown files within this folder.

## [Refactoring](Refactoring.md)

If you are a JS novice, here's how to get started:
1. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (we use `^16`, the latest LTS)
2. Run `npm i` in this repo to install dependencies
3. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests
4. Run `npm start` to launch `index.js` for any manual testing
